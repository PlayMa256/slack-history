Especially if they just contain markup — you&#39;re basically testing that React works, and we have tests in React itself for that. I think some combination of integration tests for higher-level UI scenarios (click a button, something shows up) and unit tests for <em>logic</em> (e.g. complex calculations) is helpful. I&#39;m more skeptical of asserting on component output although I understand others might not agree.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2) Styling | What is your opinion of css-in-js?

But my guess is this is about the case where you have a parent and child component that each request some data, but it could&#39;ve been requested in parallel.</p>\n<p>With “suspense” APIs (part of async React), we think it’s much simpler to “move” async dependencies up and down the tree without re-wiring the props or changing the app architecture. This is because all components are backed by the same cache. So I think async React would help avoid waterfalls by making it easier to optimistically <em>preload</em> resources that you think components below will need. Similar to <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&gt;</code> in HTML.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>how will async react improve react native?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s work in progress on revamping React Native architecture to better take advantage of async rendering and solving some existing pain points regarding interop with sync code. I’m not the best person to talk about that though.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what is take on flow/typescript and reason?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m personally comfortable with JS + some sprinkles of Flow where I’m not confident what’s going on with types. Not a fan of having to annotate everything. I haven’t tried Reason yet so I don’t know if I’ll like it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what next after relay modern?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t know, is there something missing in it? My understanding is that the Relay team is happy with performance wins from Modern. We might need to change the React bindings to it to better take advantage of the upcoming React async features, but I don’t know more.</p>\n",

After about a year I bumped into Jing Chen at React Europe (I think she was on the Relay team at the time, although I’m not sure). She asked if I was interested in interviewing, and mentioned the London office. I said that I am, so she arranged for other speakers to interview me on the next day (so I skipped most of the conference), but it was a regular FB interview process (several interviews).</p>\n",

Whether you use Redux-the-library or not, this pattern might be handy for some cases.

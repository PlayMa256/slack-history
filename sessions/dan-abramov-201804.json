Especially if they just contain markup — you&#39;re basically testing that React works, and we have tests in React itself for that. I think some combination of integration tests for higher-level UI scenarios (click a button, something shows up) and unit tests for <em>logic</em> (e.g. complex calculations) is helpful. I&#39;m more skeptical of asserting on component output although I understand others might not agree.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2) Styling | What is your opinion of css-in-js?

But my guess is this is about the case where you have a parent and child component that each request some data, but it could&#39;ve been requested in parallel.</p>\n<p>With “suspense” APIs (part of async React), we think it’s much simpler to “move” async dependencies up and down the tree without re-wiring the props or changing the app architecture. This is because all components are backed by the same cache. So I think async React would help avoid waterfalls by making it easier to optimistically <em>preload</em> resources that you think components below will need. Similar to <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&gt;</code> in HTML.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>how will async react improve react native?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s work in progress on revamping React Native architecture to better take advantage of async rendering and solving some existing pain points regarding interop with sync code. I’m not the best person to talk about that though.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what is take on flow/typescript and reason?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m personally comfortable with JS + some sprinkles of Flow where I’m not confident what’s going on with types. Not a fan of having to annotate everything. I haven’t tried Reason yet so I don’t know if I’ll like it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what next after relay modern?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t know, is there something missing in it? My understanding is that the Relay team is happy with performance wins from Modern. We might need to change the React bindings to it to better take advantage of the upcoming React async features, but I don’t know more.</p>\n"

A fuzz test is like a test that generates some inputs randomly many times, and then asserts some conditions that we expect to always be true. If there’s a regression, we add it to a list of inputs that must always be tested. So that helps refine a fuzz test over time.</p>\n"

The point of Redux isn&#39;t &quot;Redux-the-library&quot;, it&#39;s the pattern of separating update logic from descriptions of &quot;what happened&quot;. Whether you use Redux-the-library or not, this pattern might be handy for some cases. I wrote an article a long time ago that both describes these cases and describes &quot;Redux without Redux&quot; at the end: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367\">https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367</a></p>\n<p>I will also quote my earlier reply:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>90% of &quot;learning Redux&quot; isn&#39;t about Redux itself. It&#39;s about learning to use functional composition and immutability. That would come in handy regardless of whether you plan to use Redux APIs or rediscover the same patterns yourself when you use context API or something similar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Medium</p>\n<p>You Might Not Need Redux – Dan Abramov – Medium</p>\n<p>People often choose Redux before they need it. “What if our app doesn’t scale without it?”</p>\n<p>Reading time</p>\n<p>3 min read</p>\n<p>Sep 19th, 2016</p>\n"

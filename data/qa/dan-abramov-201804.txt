1) Tests | We went from 0 to 100 in what regards unit testing. It’s pretty common nowadays to find companies that have very high thresholds on unit testings. Do you think that it’s valuable to impose a high unit test coverage even for presentational components?

2) Styling | What is your opinion of css-in-js? Do you prefer it over standard stylesheets (scss, css-modules, post-css etc) or it’s more interesting to use a css-in-js lib? If so, which one? (styled-components)?

Personally I don't find unit testing components very valuable. Especially if they just contain markup — you're basically testing that React works, and we have tests in React itself for that. I think some combination of integration tests for higher-level UI scenarios (click a button, something shows up) and unit tests for _logic_ (e.g. complex calculations) is helpful. I'm more skeptical of asserting on component output although I understand others might not agree.

>2) Styling | What is your opinion of css-in-js? Do you prefer it over standard stylesheets (scss, css-modules, post-css etc) or it’s more interesting to use a css-in-js lib? If so, which one? (styled-components)?

I don't care about this much. If I were writing something today for myself I'd probably use vanilla CSS. Maybe glamor if there were a lot of dynamic styles.

Dan [3:14 PM]
>how will async react help in handling requests waterfall?

Not sure what exactly is being asked. But my guess is this is about the case where you have a parent and child component that each request some data, but it could've been requested in parallel.

With “suspense” APIs (part of async React), we think it’s much simpler to “move” async dependencies up and down the tree without re-wiring the props or changing the app architecture. This is because all components are backed by the same cache. So I think async React would help avoid waterfalls by making it easier to optimistically _preload_ resources that you think components below will need. Similar to `<link rel="preload">` in HTML.

>how will async react improve react native?

There's work in progress on revamping React Native architecture to better take advantage of async rendering and solving some existing pain points regarding interop with sync code. I’m not the best person to talk about that though.

>what is take on flow/typescript and reason?

I’m personally comfortable with JS + some sprinkles of Flow where I’m not confident what’s going on with types. Not a fan of having to annotate everything. I haven’t tried Reason yet so I don’t know if I’ll like it.

>what next after relay modern?

I don’t know, is there something missing in it? My understanding is that the Relay team is happy with performance wins from Modern. We might need to change the React bindings to it to better take advantage of the upcoming React async features, but I don’t know more.

If this is about components, I’ll reiterate we don’t do that much unit testing of components at Facebook.

If this is about React itself, we’re using fuzzy testing in some cases where there are too many possibilities. A fuzz test is like a test that generates some inputs randomly many times, and then asserts some conditions that we expect to always be true. If there’s a regression, we add it to a list of inputs that must always be tested. So that helps refine a fuzz test over time.

I’ve chatted to recruiters a long time ago but they didn’t have any UK positions at the time, and I couldn’t get a US visa (and didn’t want one that much anyway). After about a year I bumped into Jing Chen at React Europe (I think she was on the Relay team at the time, although I’m not sure). She asked if I was interested in interviewing, and mentioned the London office. I said that I am, so she arranged for other speakers to interview me on the next day (so I skipped most of the conference), but it was a regular FB interview process (several interviews).

If someone is starting Studying React today do you think it still a good idea study redux as well?

Dan [3:21 PM]
>If someone is starting Studying React today do you think it still a good idea study redux as well?

I always suggested learning React first before you look at Redux.

After you've learned React, I think learning Redux makes sense even if you don't plan to use it. 90% of "learning Redux" isn't about Redux itself. It's about learning to use functional composition and immutability. That would come in handy regardless of whether you plan to use Redux APIs or rediscover the same patterns yourself when you use context API or something similar.

Semicolons.

Okay, I'm kidding.

If you don't have any type checker, I think it's most important to look out for potential crashes (`null` / `undefined`) as those are painful to diagnose and fix. Other than that, I don't know—depends on the kind of mistakes you usually notice and want to reduce?

Hello Dan, I’m a great fan, really appreciate you taking your time to answer some questions here!
So, I’m a junior developer that has been working with React and Javascript in general for less than a year. I’d like to ask you about your first steps into the programming world, what motivated you the most to keep going before you had any palpable success and what would you recommend a junior developer in dedicating himself in 2018?

Dan [3:29 PM]
>I’d like to ask you about your first steps into the programming world, what motivated you the most to keep going before you had any palpable success and what would you recommend a junior developer in dedicating himself in 2018?

I started with Visual Basic so that's kind of a long time ago. Throwing things on a form and seeing it "come alive" when I press "run" was pretty magical. I don't think there was anything else that motivated really, I just liked making things.

I recommend building lots of small things

Not much a tech question but, how is the mood inside Facebook about this Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal? Can we expect big changes on the FB developers polices or any chance the open source tools licenses being reveiewed?

Dan [3:34 PM]
>Not much a tech question but, how is the mood inside Facebook about this Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal? Can we expect big changes on the FB developers polices or any chance the open source tools licenses being reveiewed?

The APIs that allowed this "breach" were closed down four years ago. I think at the time the policy was really naïve but there were also a lot of people who argued data should be "more open" and FB is evil for "locking it down". So it's interesting how the perspective changes over a few years.

I think it's clear to everybody at the company now that the old vision was too idealistic, but even though they closed it down four years ago, the old mistakes keep chasing them :slightly_smiling_face: . I know there's a lot of people working hard on fixing problems like fake news, election integrity, abuse etc, so I think the company will survive through this and become wiser.

I don't see how this relates to open source tools. Regarding developer APIs, yes, there's been some further lockdown on data apps could get, you can read about those changes at https://newsroom.fb.com.

Do you think that the new versions of React - 16.3.0 and beyond - are going in a direction that will improve state management power to the point where Redux might become useless?

Dan [3:39 PM]
>Do you think that the new versions of React - 16.3.0 and beyond - are going in a direction that will improve state management power to the point where Redux might become useless?

I think I sort of answered that. The point of Redux isn't "Redux-the-library", it's the pattern of separating update logic from descriptions of "what happened". Whether you use Redux-the-library or not, this pattern might be handy for some cases. I wrote an article a long time ago that both describes these cases and describes "Redux without Redux" at the end: https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367

I will also quote my earlier reply:

>90% of "learning Redux" isn't about Redux itself. It's about learning to use functional composition and immutability. That would come in handy regardless of whether you plan to use Redux APIs or rediscover the same patterns yourself when you use context API or something similar.
